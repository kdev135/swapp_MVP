# swapp_MVP

- This is a minimum viable product (M.V.P) of the Swapp, an app that allows for the
exchange of unneeded items for other items or cash. 
- The owner of a product uploads an item with the relevan details about it and receives bids

from intersted parties. The owner can then select the bid that is most attractive to them.
- A party cannot place bid on a product that was uploaded from their account.
