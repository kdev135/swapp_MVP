# swapp_MVP
- This is a minimum viable product (M.V.P) of Swapp, an app that allows for the exchange of unneeded items for other items or cash. 

## UI design
The user interface for part of the app is available here: https://dribbble.com/shots/17817188-Swapp-e-commerce-app

## The basics
- The owner of a product uploads the item with the relevant details and awaits to receive bids from interested parties.
A logged in user of the app can view available products from the catalog screen.

- A party cannot place bid on an item that was uploaded from their account. If one attempts to place a bid on their own item,they will be denied progress to the bidding screen and notified via a snackbar at the bottom of the screen. This behaviour is shown in the screenshot below.

-If the product belongs to a different account, the user will be directed to the bid screen where they can select their preffered bid method and finally conclude the bid.
